                This project feels like it is in the HOF (no bias). The UI Jeremy and I came up with was astounding and the Pocketbase database was so smooth to work with.

                Note: If I ever want to make a fullstack application, I'm recommending Pocketbase, because of how fast it was to set up posts and tables.
