                We believe Wildscape has a great user concept behind it. In the future, we really want to expand beyond the time limit we were given. Wildscape deserves a more integrated
                approach with Google Maps API, such that it can go directly in POV mode to see the spot. Additionally, implementing AI to differentiate between real nature photos, AI photos,
                and spam photos would help keep our dashboard and mission values rich. It would also be great to turn this into a mobile app, along with partnering with environmental sustainability
                stakeholders, such as the National Park Service.
