                While playing a fullstack role in this capstone, my skills shined applying every aspect of UI/UX development, from <span className={"font-bold"}> user research, prototyping,
                UI development, user testing, and writing a case study</span>. I have gained invaluable experience working within a remote yet dynamic team, and I will never forget this with such
                wonderful people. I am confident that I am ready to apply what I have into the UI/UX industry.
