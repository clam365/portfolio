                Over the summer of 2024 along with the first quarter of the school year, I completed my Major Qualifying
                Project (MQP). This application is designed for WPI
                undergrads to collect and analyze their data for their Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP)
                across the globe. I created the application Figma mockups and major frontend components based on user needs.
