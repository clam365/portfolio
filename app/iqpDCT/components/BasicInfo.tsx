                Over the summer of 2024 along with the first quarter of the school year, I completed my Major Qualifying
                Project (MQP). This PERN stack application is designed for WPI
                undergrads to collect and analyze their data for their Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP)
                across the globe. I led the design and development of the responsive user interface for the project,
                spearheading Figma mockups along with conducting user research and testing, all with positive feedback from our stakeholders.
