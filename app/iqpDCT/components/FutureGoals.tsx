                Our overarching goal was to create a concept application backed by the use case needs of students and we
                have done exactly that. The <span className={"font-bold"}>WPI President Grace Wang & the
                Global Studies Dean</span> have shown significant interest, meaning this could very well be used in the near
                future for standardization. Not only have we gained
                significant feedback from students, it has ADDITIONALLY gained traction by word of mouth across campus.

                There are a couple things we would want to implement if this would be continued to be built upon. First,
                the collaboration with the IT department is necessary, as we would
                want to <span className={"font-bold"}>connect to the WPI database</span>  so that students can connect
                in with their own secure logins, and have the projects associated to them much easier and efficiently. Secondly, <span className={"font-bold"}>utilize Google Maps API</span>.
                Unfortunately, their API is not free, and initially we wanted the ability for users to easily select predetermined locations that were clickable, such as restaurants or attractions to put down their data.
